Notes for how stuff was setup

I keep forgetting to write this stuff down, and after I buggered this snowflake again.  I realized I know better... I know better because I automate this stuff for a living.

1.  Write things down
2.  Document why things were done that way
3.  Automate the crap out of everything
4.  Automate the crap out of the automation
5.  Review the above steps and laugh at the stupid decisions that were made , and repeat steps 1 - 5.
